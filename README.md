Carrier Scheduling and Management Tool

Carrier Scheduling and Management Tool is a multi-purpose program to handle incoming inventory deliveries
of raw materials for use in manufacturing. In it's primary application, it is meant to be used to track
incoming roll stock deliveries in the corrugated manufacturing industry.

<b><h1>Existing System</h1></b>
<p>Carrier scheduling is now entered in an analog system (pen and paper). Each carrier is recorded along with the
following:</p>
<ul>       
	<li>Vendor</li>
	<li>Roll Width</li>        
    <li>Roll Grade</li>
    <li>Delivery Time, as follows:</li>
    <ul>
    	<li>30 minute intervals between 7am - 9am</li>
    	<li>15 minute intervals between 9am - 1pm</li>
    	<li>30 minute intervals between 1pm - 6:30pm</li>
    </ul>
    <li>AM Delivery confirmation number (starting with 1-5 depending on day of the week. eg:</li>
    <ul>
		<li>AM1234 Monday</li>
		<li>AM2123 Tuesday</li>
		<li>AM3456 Wednesday</li>
		<li>etc</li>
	</ul>	
	<li>Load # if applicable</li>
</ul>
<b><h1>Areas of Opportunity</h1></b>
<p>While this process has been in place for years, it leaves some inefficiencies that can be fixed</p>
<p>CSMT can rectify these inefficiencies by solving a few issues that arise from using an analog system</p>
<ol>
	<li>The pen and paper system is outdated - transitioning to a digital system will ultimately reap more benefits</li>
	<li>Digital system can allow for automatic tracking of late deliveries and reschedules, as opLoadsed to whiting out and copying 		information from day to day</li>
	<li>CSMT will remove multiple points of failures that can occur from reducing the chance of duplicate Load's and AM delivery		numbers by restricting each delivery to have one AM number and one Load number automatically generated by the system, reducing 		human error</li>
<b><h1>Tasks CSMT Must Complete </h1></b>
<ol>
	<li>Must schedule incoming deliveries</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Assign Vendors to Carriers</li>
		<li>Assign Load #'s to Carriers</li>
		<li>Assign one and onlt one AM # per delivery</li>
		<li>Schedule one carrier per time slot as outlined below</li>
		<ol>
			<li>30 minute intervals, 7-9am</li>
			<li>15 minute intervals, 9am-1pm</li>
			<li>30 minute intervals, 1pm - 6:30pm</li>
			<li><b>NO Deliveries between 12-1230pm</b></li>
			<li>Saturday deliveries stop at 2pm, 30 minute intervals 8am-2pm
		</ol>
	</ol>
		<li>Need to generate a report for the day</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Should be in csv format or excel</li>
		<li>7 columns needed -> Load#, AM#, Vendor, Roll Width, Roll Grade, Time, Carrier</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Documents</li>
	<ol>
	<li>Must contain help documents (like pydocs) that can be accesed from within </li>
	</ol>
</ol>

<b><h1>Optional Future Updates</h1></b>
<ul>
<li>Database support to enable user logins and permissions</li>
<li>Database support to save historical delivery data (for analysis and reports)</li>
<li>Ability to create custom reports based on a number of parameter combinations</li>
<li>Shift from and create a GUI</li>
</ul>
